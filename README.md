# BeInHarmony
 This project aims to help users to improve their color and fashion sense by providing a web page where fashion coordination can be easily coordinated to modern people who have difficulty in fashion coordination by using harmonious colors.

This project provides two functions.
The first function is to select the clothes and atmosphere colors user wants, and user can see the coordinated images. If user selects clothes in one of these two cases of top / bottom, or outer / bottom, and then selects the atmosphere word, the matching image will be searched. The second function is a feature that allows users to take photos from a webcam and modify their photos in the desired atmosphere. If user selects the mood of the word format (ex: modern, cute), user get a color combination, user can coordinate user's photos taken with your webcam with the color of your chosen mood.

As a result, we will offer user coordination.
